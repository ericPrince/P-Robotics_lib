General code libraries for the Princeton Robotics Club



About
=====

This is a general repository for hlding various code libraries developed and/or used by the Princeton Robotics Club.  For information about a specific library, look at the beginning of the header file for that library (bigger libraries may have their own readme too).


How To Use
==========

Arduino: put all directories of libraries you want to include into the Arduino libraries folder, and restart the Arduino IDE.  Make sure to #include the libraries in your main Arduino code.  An Arduino library generally consists of a folder to contain it, a header file, a c++ code file, and possible a keywords file.  The header and c++ files are standard c++ files, but the keywords file tells the Arduino  how/if it should syntax highlight certain "keywords."
